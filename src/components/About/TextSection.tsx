        Hello there! I&apos;m Danny Sickels, a curious explorer at the
        intersection of food science and software. My journey began in the realm
        of Nutrition and Dietetics, fueled by a passion for understanding the
        biological science behind food and health. This path wasn&apos;t just
        about textbooks and looking good; I found myself desiring the knowledge
        that is connecting well-being, joy, and understand the body&apos;s
        efficiency through what we eat and how we live.

        The majority of my young experiences were in retail grocery and in the
        caring environment of long-term care. I learned much about understanding
        others&apos; needs and cultivated an aura of patience. I have now become
        part of the quality assurance team within a leading food manufacturer
        where I not only ensure the high standards of products, but also
        strongly advocate for food safety.

        My journey through food and health science, enriched by experiences in
        quality assurance, arm me with a unique lens when viewing problems. It
        taught me the importance of precision, value in questioning the
        ordinary, and many opportunities uncovered through meticulous attention
        to detail.

        In transitioning to this new chapter, I bring with me lessons from my
        past where I converge my diverse experiences to fuel innovation. As a
        Quality Assurance Technician aspiring to be a Software Engineer, I have
        become more than just these experiences; I am incessantly curious and
        adept, embracing any learning opportunity to solve a problem, and a
        student at heart. Thank you for reading!
