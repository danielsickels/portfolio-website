        Hello there! I&apos;m Danny Sickels, a Full Stack Developer with an 
        insatiable hunger for problem-solving, building, and creating. My 
        journey started in Nutrition and Dietetics, where I was fascinated by 
        complex systems and the science behind optimization. I&apos;ve now been 
        fascinated by this dynamic field, software development. The 
        logic, problem-solving, and endless possibilities all spark great 
        curiousity out of me to explore what I can do.

        My background in quality assurance within a large-scale food
        manufacturer sharpened my precision, adaptability, and ability 
        to thrive in high-stakes environments. I can apply those same 
        principles to software â€” writing clean, efficient code, 
        designing scalable systems, and ensuring seamless user 
        experiences.

        In my journey of becoming a Full Stacker Developer, I have
        become more than just these experiences; I am incessantly 
        curious and adept, embracing any learning opportunity to solve 
        a problem, and a student at heart. Thank you for reading!
